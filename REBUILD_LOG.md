# REBUILD_LOG.md — football_db_v2 handoff log

One section per phase. A cold session should be able to resume from the latest section alone.

## Phase 0 — Skeleton — GATE PASSED 2026-09-26

**Built** (stdlib only; no pandas/nflreadpy needed yet — the schedule is a plain CSV release asset):

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CLI | `python -m fdb {fetch,load,update,weeks,check,rebuild,weekly,hash}` | `load`/`update` are dry-run unless `--apply` |
| Raw store | `fdb/raw.py` | `data/raw/<source>/<endpoint>/<partition>/<stamp>.<ext>` + `.meta.json` sidecar. **Sidecars are the durable manifest**; `raw_fetch_log` is rebuilt from them. Files never overwritten |
| Cache rule | `raw.cache_usable` | reuse only if `is_final` AND non-empty; `is_effectively_empty` recurses |
| Loader framework | `fdb/loader.py` | 5-step contract; framework picks scopes, checks ownership, delete-scope+insert in one txn, rolls back on any check failure; `_cast` refuses to truncate `1.5` into INTEGER |
| Completeness gate | `fdb/schedule.py` | game final = result present AND kickoff + 4h + 24h passed; week complete = every game final; season closed = SB exists and final |
| Registry | `registry/sources.toml` | **TOML, not YAML** (deviation from spec §4: `tomllib` is stdlib, PyYAML is not) |
| Schema | `schema/001_meta.sql`, `002_teams.sql`, `003_core_schedule.sql` | `teams` (32) + `team_aliases` (OAK/SD/STL/LAR/LVR/JAC/WSH/ARZ/BLT/CLV/HST) |
| Schedule loader | `fdb/loaders/nflverse_schedules.py` | release asset `schedules/games.csv`; current-state feed, never final, always re-fetched (~2 MB) |
| Weekly job | `fdb/weekly.py`, `weekly.bat` | status `running` written first; stale `running` (>6h) reported; concurrent run exits 2 |
| Alerting | `fdb/alert.py` | unset → loud; non-https → refuses; failure → exception only, token never printed (verified) |
| Rebuild | `fdb/rebuild.py` | network disabled; builds to a side file, swaps only if every load passed; `app_*` exported/imported via `app_state/`; keeps 3 `pre_rebuild_*.db` |
| Tests | `tests/` (unittest, stdlib) | 23 tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests -t .` |

**Gate results (container run, real nflverse data):**
- ✅ `fdb rebuild` ×2 → identical hash `e5ca05ae…f9079`, **0 network calls**.
- ✅ `completed_weeks(2026)` = REG 1, REG 2 — correct as of Sat 2026-09-26 (week 3: 1 of 16 played). 2025 = closed, REG 1–18 + POST 19–22.
- ✅ Non-final raw is re-fetched; final raw served from cache; empty raw never final (unit tests).
- ✅ `{"x": []}`, `{"coverage_scheme": []}` treated as empty (unit test).
- ✅ Idempotency: reloading 2026 from raw leaves the hash unchanged.
- ✅ A dropped game fails the check and the season's previous rows survive (rollback test).
- ⏳ **`--test-alert` seen in Discord — DEFERRED by Turon 2026-09-26.** All three failure paths verified. Until the webhook exists, every weekly run prints "NOBODY IS TOLD" and results live only in `PIPELINE_STATUS.json`. **Open item — carry it forward in every phase's log until closed.**

**Found on the first real load — a check that failed on reality:** 2022 had **271** REG games, not 272. BUF @ CIN (week 17) was declared no-contest after Damar Hamlin's cardiac arrest. Recorded as a named exception (`CANCELLED_REG`) — **a check that fails on real data gets a named exception, never a looser tolerance.**

**Loaded:** `core_schedule` 2016–2026 = 3,033 games.

**Facts for later phases:**
- nflverse numbers playoff weeks **19–22** (2021+) and 18–21 before; **PFF uses 28/29/30/32**. The week vocabulary must be mapped explicitly when PFF arrives (Phase 4) — never assume.
- `gametime` is US Eastern. Converted with an explicit DST rule because Windows Python has no tz database without `tzdata`.
- Team values are stored verbatim in core; `team_aliases` resolves them, and a value with no alias fails the load.

**On Windows (Turon), once** (step 1–2 deferred):
1. Create a Discord webhook in a PRIVATE ops channel; add `OPS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=<url>` to `.env`.
2. `"C:\Users\k-ble\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe" -m fdb weekly --test-alert` → confirm the message arrives.
3. `... -m fdb update nflverse.schedules --apply` then `... -m fdb rebuild` then `... -m unittest discover -s tests -t .`
4. Task Scheduler: `weekly.bat`, Tuesday 05:00, StartWhenAvailable = True.

**OPEN ITEMS:** (1) Discord webhook + `--test-alert` (deferred).

**NEXT: Phase 1 — Identity** (spec §3, §8): `players` from nflverse rosters 2016–2026; `player_ids` from nflverse, Sleeper, `ff_playerids`, PFF jersey bridge; `identity_overrides.csv`; trap fixtures in §9. Phase 1 will need `pandas`/`pyarrow` if the roster assets are parquet-only — check for a CSV asset first.
